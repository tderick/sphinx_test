    "## What is it?\n",
    "pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n",
    "    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n",
    "    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n",
    "    objects\n",
    "  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n",
    "    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n",
    "    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n",
    "    align the data for you in computations\n",
    "  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n",
    "    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n",
    "    and transforming data\n",
    "  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n",
    "    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n",
    "    into DataFrame objects\n",
    "  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n",
    "    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n",
    "    large data sets\n",
    "  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n",
    "    sets\n",
    "  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n",
    "    data sets\n",
    "  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n",
    "    labels per tick)\n",
    "  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n",
    "    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n",
    "    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n",
    "  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n",
    "    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n",
    "    date shifting and lagging\n",

    "\n",
    "## Discussion and Development\n",
    "Most development discussions take place on GitHub in this repo. Further, the [pandas-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas) is available for quick development related questions.\n",

    "All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub \"issues\" tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=Docs&sort=updated&state=open) and [good first issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?labels=good+first+issue&sort=updated&state=open) where you could start out.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!\n",
